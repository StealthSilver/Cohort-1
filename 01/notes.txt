JAVASCRIPT FOUNDATIONS

languages help the developers communicate with the machine
the compilers convert the high level code into the binary code (0,1)

Features of Javascript

2. Event-Driven and Asynchronous
3. Prototype-Based Inheritance
4. First-Class Functions
5. Dynamic Typing
6. Standardized with ECMAScript
7. JS is single threaded (not good for scaleable systems)
