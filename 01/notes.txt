JAVASCRIPT FOUNDATIONS

languages help the developers communicate with the machine
the compilers convert the high level code into the binary code (0,1)

Features of Javascript

1. Interpreted and Executed in Real Time (JIT : just in time compiled)
2. Event-Driven and Asynchronous
3. Prototype-Based Inheritance
4. First-Class Functions
5. Dynamic Typing
6. Standardized with ECMAScript
7. single threaded (not good for scaleable systems)
in go lang -> sub-routiunes implement multithreading

JS BASICS

1. output
2. input
3. variables
4. data types
5. operators
6. conditionals
7. loops
8. complex data types 
9. functions 
10. classes

JS FUNCTIONS 

1. String 
2. Number 
3. Array 
4. Class 
5. Date 
6. JSON (java script object notation) 
7. Math 
8. Objects 

functions are required so that we dont violate the DRY(Don't repeat yourself) principle

CALLBACK FUNCTIONS 

calling functions as the argument of another function 

SYNC vs ASYNC FUNCTIONS

SYNC : together , one after the other
ASYNC : multiple things context switching with each other

examples of async functions
1. set timeout
2. fs.readFile
3. fetch

JS async architecture (latentfilp.com)

call stack : it is the main stack where all the functions are called

web apis : the async function clocks are deligated here

callback queue : all the resolved async functions are queued here and then called by the callback stack one by one
the async callbacks are only called when the js thread gets free
